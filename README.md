ocMPI is a lightweight version of mpi. 

The oc prefix stands from on-chip.

Building
--------

I provide a Netbeans project, but you can also compile with command line

<pre>make -f Makefile.cygwin all</pre>

this will create a build directory with the compiled examples


Use the *config.h* file to change the number of processors used in shared memory systems.

Testing 
-------

By now I build the mpiqueens2 example application to compute nqueens (with 8x8 board). Several executables are build, 
to compare the performance obtained with different buffering options (single queue, or mailbox matrix).
